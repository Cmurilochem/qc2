qc2 is a modular software designed to seamlessly integrate traditional computational chemistry codes
and quantum computing frameworks.
It is specifically crafted for hybrid quantum-classical workflows
such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm :cite:p:`REV_VQE:2022,REV_QC4QC:2019`.
The software relies on custom `ASE calculators <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_ as well as formatted data files
(*e.g.*, `QCSchema <https://molssi.org/software/qcschema-2/>`_ or FCIDump :cite:p:`FCIDump:1989`) to efficiently offload 1- and 2-electron
integrals needed by various Python quantum computing libraries; see :ref:`code_structure`.

The qc2 software is a direct outcome of the `QCforQC project <https://research-software-directory.org/projects/qcforqc>`_,
a collaboration between `Netherlands eScience Center <https://www.esciencecenter.nl/>`_,
`Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) <https://vu.nl/nl>`_ and `SURF <https://www.surf.nl/>`_.


Current status of qc2
=====================

In its current version, qc2 can perform VQE calculations using
both `Qiskit Nature <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/nature/>`_ and `PennyLane <https://pennylane.ai/>`_,
along with the following computational chemistry programs:

* `PySCF <https://pyscf.org/>`_
* `Psi4 <https://psicode.org/>`_
* `DIRAC <https://www.diracprogram.org/>`_
* `ROSE <https://gitlab.com/quantum_rose/rose>`_ [#f1]_

For these programs, custom qc2-ASE calculators are developed that
implement additional methods to retrieve and dump qchem data into formatted data files; see :ref:`ase_section`.

.. note::

  qc2-ASE calculators for `ADF <https://www.scm.com/>`_ and `MOLCAS <https://www.molcas.org/>`_ are
  currently under development and will be available soon.
